    <h3> Timing Analysis </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Since the run time of DFS is linear in the size of the graph, that is, O(V+E). The time-complexity 
            of Kosaraju's algorithm is O(V+E) since it uses just two DFS-executions. This can also be seen from the graph,
            of time vs graph-size.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The main plus-point of the DCSC algorithm was ease of parallelizability due to independent function 
            calls of the divided problem. However, the serial execution suffers from a bad complexity in the worst Crashed
            which is quadratic in the input vertices. The expected run time of the algorithm is O(ElgV). The actual serial implementation also suffers from some losses according to which data-structure is used to implement predecessor and successor data-structures. 
            </p>

	<h3>Assumptions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The program expects certain command-line arguments to be provided for it to run
			correctly.
			<br>
			<br>
            Program Usage - 
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./getScc graphFile alg [resultsFile]
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graphFile - file containing information about graph
			<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alg - algorithm to use for getting components (dfs or dcsc)
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resultsFile - optional file for writing back results
        </li>
        <br>
		<li>
            The format of the graph file is as follows -
            <p>
                The first line contains two space-seperated integers V, E where V represents
                the number of vertices in the digraph, and E represents the number of edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the following lines have two space-seperated integers x, y representing
                an edge from the vertex x to vertex y.
            </p>
		</li>

    <h3> Coding Issues </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The Depth-First-Search based algorithm was straight-forward to implement. The two DFS-executions
            were implemented with the help of the stack ADT present in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The Divide-And-Conquer based algorithm was a bit tricky to implement, since it runs on subgraphs in its
            recursive calls. The vertices in the subgraph had to be calculated at each stage, and stored in an efficient
            data structure, a reference to which was passed in further calls. An efficient data-structure was also to be used for the predecessor and descendent sets. We used an STL vector of integers to denote
            vertices in the subgraph, and a boolean vector to represent predecessor and descendent sets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Our initial assumption was that the vertices are numbered from [0, V-1] where V is the total number of edges.
            However, in some graph files, this was not true. We fixed this by having the DiGraph data-structure be unaware of the actual numbers and keep the internal numbering from [0, V-1]. Conversions to-and-fro was done while inserting edges, and printing components using an unordered_map from the C++ STL.
            </p>
